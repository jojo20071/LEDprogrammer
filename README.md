# LED Control Script

This Python script provides functionalities to control an LED, enabling various lighting effects such as blinking, fading, or constant illumination. It is intended for use in projects that require basic LED management. The script is straightforward to configure, making it easy to integrate into different hardware setups.

### Features
- **Blinking**: Make the LED blink at a specified frequency.
- **Fading**: Gradually increase or decrease the LED brightness.
- **Constant Light**: Keep the LED illuminated at a fixed brightness.

### Usage
To use this script, ensure your hardware is correctly wired to the appropriate GPIO pins (if using a Raspberry Pi or similar platform). Adjust the parameters within the script to customize the LED's behavior.
